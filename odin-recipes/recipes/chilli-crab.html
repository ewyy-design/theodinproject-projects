            <h1>Chilli Crab</h1>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Hard-shell crabs cooked in semi-thick gravy with a tomato chilli base. The steamed crabs are partially 
                cracked, then lightly stir-fried in a paste comprising of chilli sauce, ketchup and eggs. Despite its name, 
                chilli crab is not all that spicy. Bread is normally ordered to soak up the gravy, so dig in with both 
                hands!</p>
            <br>

                <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups chicken stock (360 mL)</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups tomato puree (335 g)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
                <li>½ cup sweet chili sauce (120 g)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons palm sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 spring onion</li>
                <li>½ cup butter (50 g)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the crab by removing the base flap, then pull off the head and clear out the cavity. Keep the 
                    head in a bowl. Moving to the body of the crab, remove the gills, which are an opaque brown colour on 
                    both sides of the crab. Using a sharp knife, cut the crab in half down the middle, then divide into six 
                    parts. Using the knife, crack the crab legs open to allow the flavours to enhance while cooking. Add to 
                    the bowl with the head then set aside.</li>
                <li>In a food processor, add shallots, ginger, red chillies, garlic, ketchup, and shrimp paste, then pulse 
                    until it comes together and forms a paste.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a wok over medium heat, then once it comes up to temperature fry add the chilli paste and cook 
                    for five minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>   
                <li>Add the crab pieces into the wok and stir until they are fully coated. Give the crab time to start turning orange, 
                    approximately 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato puree, chicken stock, rice wine vinegar, sweet chilli sauce, soy sauce and palm sugar, 
                    then stir until completely mixed. The crab should be fully orange by now. Add a lid on top and allow the 
                    mixture to simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the crab legs and head, and plate up on a shallow dish.</li>
                <li>Add butter, spring onions, and egg. Let the egg sit for a minute before stirring, then give the sauce a quick stir. 
                    The sauce should thicken up quickly.</li>
                <li>Pour the sauce on top of the crab and garnish with a few sprigs of coriander.</li>
            </ol>
