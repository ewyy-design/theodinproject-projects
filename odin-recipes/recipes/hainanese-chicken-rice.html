                <li>¼ cup sesame oil (60 mL)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chicken fat, chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

                <li>2 cups reserved chicken poaching broth (480 mL)</li>

            <br>
            
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>To clean the chicken, rub all over with a handful of kosher salt, getting rid of any loose skin. 
                    Rinse the chicken well inside and out. Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
                <li>Remove any excess fat from the chicken and set aside for later.</li>
                <li>Season the chicken generously with salt. Stuff the chicken cavity with the ginger slices and scallions.</li>   
                <li>Place the chicken in a large stock pot, cover with cold water by 1 inch (2 cm), and season with salt 
                    to taste.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to low to maintain a simmer. Cover and cook 
                    for about 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (75°C). Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
                <li>Remove the chicken from the pot, reserving the poaching liquid for later, and transfer to an ice bath for 5 
                    minutes to stop the cooking process and to keep the chicken skin springy. Discard the ginger and green onion.</li>
                <li>After it’s cooled, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and rub all over with sesame oil. This will help prevent the 
                    chicken from drying out.</li>
                <li>In a large wok or skillet, heat ¼ cup (60 ml) of sesame oil over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved chopped 
                    chicken fat, the garlic, ginger, and salt, and fry until aromatic, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reserve ¼ of the fried garlic mixture, then add the rice to the remaining fried garlic and stir to coat. 
                    Cook for 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the rice to a rice cooker and add 2 cups (480 ml) of reserved poaching broth. Steam the rice for 
                    60 minutes, or until tender.</li>
                <li>While the rice is cooking, carve the chicken for serving.</li>
                <li>Serve the sliced chicken with the rice, dipping sauces, sliced cucumbers, and fresh cilantro.</li>
            </ol>
